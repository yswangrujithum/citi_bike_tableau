## Obstacles
* The only limiting factor for this project is the time. Data from other city bike company should be obtained in order to compare them closely. 
* Certain data is too ambiguous. For instance, participants with the age of 130 years old has riden the bike. 
* The files were too large to save on the public Tableau, so I have to seperate the two datasets and work on them seperately. 
* All of the files were to large to upload onto the GitHub.
